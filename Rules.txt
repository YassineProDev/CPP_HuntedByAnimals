"Player hunted by wild Animals" is a game where the player controls a character on a squared ground. The object of the game is to avoid being devoured by the beasts present on the ground. Wildcats seek to catch the player, while the player seeks to trick them into traps or get in each other's way, or even devour each other.

The game follows these rules:

- If a beast moves onto the cell occupied by the player, the player is devoured, and the game   ends.
- If a beast needs to move onto a cell occupied by another beast of the same type, it avoids confrontation and remains in place.
- If a beast needs to move onto a cell occupied by a beast of a different type, it launches a surprise attack, killing the other beast.
- If a beast moves onto a cell with a trap, it falls into the trap and dies.

The game ends when the player is devoured or when all beasts have been eliminated (traps or killed).

At the start of the game you will have the possibility to choose between the default terrain or a terrain imported from a file. The file should be placed in the file "files" and its structure should match that of the file "example.txt" . There are two game modes, simple mode where the player can move in all directions and hard mode where the player can move only horizontally and vertically. If you choose the default grid you will have the possibility to choose the game mode. If you import the grid from a file you will have to represent the player on the grid according to the desired game mode. Here are the representation of the elements on the grid. (D = Player in difficult mode  -  P = Player in normal mode  -  L = Lion  - C = Cheetah  -  T = Trap  -  R = Rock).
